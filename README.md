(In progress)

System requirements:
Python 3, ffmpeg, google-api-python-client, requests, pysrt, progressbar2, six


Python 3 and Windows should be ready soon-ish!

In Windows, you should install this by placing it in your %ProgramFiles% folder, and adding %ProgramFiles%/autosub to your PATH.

Mac is a bit more complex: you need to place the bash files in /usr/bin/local,
take ownership of them with chmod, and make them executable.
